# 0x02-ES6_classes

Welcome to the **0x02-ES6_classes** project directory! This directory contains projects and exercises that focus on ES6 classes in JavaScript. These exercises are part of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum and are designed to help you understand and implement ES6 class syntax and concepts effectively.

## Project Structure

- **0-classroom.js**: A module defining a `Classroom` class with specific attributes.
- **1-make_classrooms.js**: A module that imports the `Classroom` class and creates multiple classroom instances.
- **2-hbtn_course.js**: A module defining a `HolbertonCourse` class with various attributes and methods.
- **3-currency.js**: A module defining a `Currency` class to represent different currencies.
- **4-pricing.js**: A module defining a `Pricing` class that includes a method to calculate the price in different currencies.
- **5-building.js**: A module defining an abstract `Building` class with a method that must be implemented by subclasses.
- **6-sky_high.js**: A module defining a `SkyHighBuilding` class that extends the `Building` class.
- **7-airport.js**: A module defining an `Airport` class with specific attributes.
- **8-hbtn_class.js**: A module defining a `HolbertonClass` class with specific attributes and methods.
- **9-hoisting.js**: An exercise to demonstrate the hoisting behavior of classes in JavaScript.
