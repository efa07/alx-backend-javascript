## Introduction

This repository is part of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum. It focuses on understanding and utilizing ES6 Promises to manage asynchronous code in JavaScript. Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations by returning a promise object that can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/efa07/alx-backend-javascript.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd alx-backend-javascript/0x01-ES6_promise
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the exercises, use the following command:

```sh
node <filename>.js
```
Replace <filename> with the name of the JavaScript file you want to
