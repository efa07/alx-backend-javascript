# 0x04-TypeScript
Welcome to the TypeScript module of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum. This module covers the fundamentals and advanced concepts of TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of TypeScript and its advantages over JavaScript
- Define and use types and interfaces
- Use TypeScript in development projects
- Configure the TypeScript compiler
- Implement advanced TypeScript features such as generics, decorators, and modules
## Requirements
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- TypeScript compiler (v4.0 or higher)
## Installation
To get started with TypeScript, you need to install the TypeScript compiler globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
You can verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
tsc --version
```
## Directory Structure
This directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the module.
- task_0/: Directory containing the files for task 0.
- task_1/: Directory containing the files for task 1.
- task_2/: Directory containing the files for task 2.
- task_3/: Directory containing the files for task 3.
- task_4/: Directory containing the files for task 4.

Each subdirectory contains the necessary TypeScript files (.ts), JavaScript files (.js), and configuration files needed to complete the tasks.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Basic Types
- Objective: Learn and implement basic types in TypeScript.
- Files: task_0/main.ts
- Instructions:
   - Create and use basic types: number, string, boolean, array, tuple, enum, and any.
### Task 1: Interfaces and Functions
 - Objective: Define and use interfaces and functions in TypeScript.
- Files: task_1/main.ts
- Instructions:
  - Define interfaces for objects and functions.
   - Implement functions with typed parameters and return types.
### Task 2: Classes and Inheritance
- Objective: Work with classes, constructors, and inheritance in TypeScript.
- Files: task_2/main.ts
- Instructions:
 * Create classes with properties and methods.
 * Implement inheritance between classes.
### Task 3: Generics
- Objective: Implement generics to create reusable components.
- Files: task_3/main.ts
- Instructions:
* Create generic functions and classes.
### Task 4: Decorators and Modules
- Objective: Use decorators and modules to structure your code.
- Files: task_4/main.ts
- Instructions:
* Implement decorators to add metadata and modify behavior.
* Use modules to organize code into reusable chunks.
## Usage
To compile and run TypeScript files, follow these steps:

Navigate to the directory containing the TypeScript file (e.g., task_0/).

Compile the TypeScript file using the TypeScript compiler:

```bash
tsc main.ts
```
Run the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js:

```bash
node main.js
```
