## Description
This project covers various aspects of data manipulation in JavaScript using ES6 features. It includes tasks that will help you practice and master techniques such as working with arrays, objects, and other data structures. By completing these exercises, you'll improve your ability to handle and transform data in JavaScript effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand and use the different methods for manipulating arrays and objects in ES6.
Apply ES6 features to simplify and improve data manipulation code.
Write clean, efficient, and readable JavaScript code for data manipulation tasks.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and ES6 features.
- Node.js installed on your local machine for running scripts (optional).

## Project Structure
The directory contains the following files:

- README.md: This file.
- 0-get_list_students.js: JavaScript file containing a function to retrieve a list of students.
- 1-get_list_student_ids.js: JavaScript file containing a function to get a list of student IDs.
- 2-get_student_ids_sum.js: JavaScript file containing a function to calculate the sum of student IDs.
- 3-get_student_by_location.js: JavaScript file containing a function to get students by location.
- 4-update_student_grade_by_city.js: JavaScript file containing a function to update student grades by city.
- 5-typed_arrays.js: JavaScript file containing examples of using typed arrays.
- 6-set.js: JavaScript file containing examples of using sets.
- 7-has-values-from-array.js: JavaScript file containing a function to check if a set has values from an array.
- 8-clean_set.js: JavaScript file containing a function to clean a set.
- 9-groceries_list.js: JavaScript file containing examples of using maps.
- 10-update_unique_items.js: JavaScript file containing a function to update unique items in a map.
- 100-weak.js: JavaScript file containing examples of using weak maps and weak sets.

## Usage
To run the JavaScript files and test the functions, you can use Node.js. For example:

```bash
node 0-get_list_students.js
```
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your local machine. You can download it from Node.js official website.
